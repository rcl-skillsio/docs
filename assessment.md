# Assessment Plans in RCL Skills.IO
**V7**

A learner will need to be assessed by a mentor to complete a module and earn a digital badge. In this section, we will learn about the assessment plan.

## Assessment Plan

An *Assessment Plan* will be developed for the learner by the mentor. The assessment plan will describe the assessment, the planned date of the assessment and provide the following links :

- The **Coding Assignment** link to complete a **Coding Challenge** using GitHub Classroom

- The **Coding Interview** link to attend an online virtual meeting  in Microsoft Teams to be interviewed by a mentor

## Notification of an Assessment Plan

The mentor will send an email notification to the learner, informing the learner that an assessment plan has been developed. A link to the assessment plan will be included in the email.

The learner must respond to the mentor and state if the planned date and time of the coding interview is convenient, or else, recommend a more suitable date and time.
