# Introduction to RCL Skills.IO
**V7**

RCL Skills.IO is an online platform for assisting learners to achieve workplace competence in software development. It uses a unique workplace methodology to ensure learners achieve competence. It is a **one-on-one** system where an expert developer acting as a *mentor* will work with a *learner*. The methodology includes:

- the learner completing software development projects on GitHub
- the mentor will review the learner's code and provide useful feedback 
- the mentor will conduct a *coding interview* with the learner in a virtual meeting to determine the learner's skill and knowledge
- the mentor will create a *digital badge* for the learner to track his/her achievement when competence is achieved

## Modules

A **module** is a discrete area of workplace learning in which a learner would achieve competence. A *specification* is provided for each module to outline the competences that the learner must achieve to earn a badge for the module. The mentor will work with the learner as outlined above for the learner to achieve the competences.

## Learning Path

A learner will complete several modules based on their desired learning path. A learning path will define which modules are required for its achievement. After completing a learning path, the learner will be given a summative badge by the mentor.
